Please find the unit test template for your feature at:
src/test/java/org/jointheleague/features/templates/FeatureTemplateTest

For your feature, you will want to update line 26 to be an instance of your class, then use the replace all feature
to replace "featureTemplate" with the name of your instance throughout the test class.

Uncomment the test on line 62 that checks that the command is not equal to "!command".  This is commented out so that
the template doesn't fail this unit test.
